## Annotation-Free Character Detection in Historical Vietnamese Stele Images

This repository contains the source code for self-calibration and samples of the synthetic training data for the following paper, which has been accepted for publication at the 16th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition ([ICDAR 2021 Proceedings](https://icdar2021.org/proceedings/), Part I).

Anna Scius-Bertrand, Michael Jungo, Beat Wolf, Andreas Fischer, and Marc Bui, "Annotation-Free Character Detection in Historical Vietnamese Stele Images". *Proc. 16th Int. Conf. on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pages 432-447, 2021.*

Requirements for the self-calibration code:

- [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) installed in "../yolov5/" with a conda environment named "yolo"

- Latest version of the Nom font "NomNaTongLight.ttf" downloaded from the [Nom Foundation](http://www.nomfoundation.org/nom-tools/Nom-Font?uiLang=en)

We provide samples of the synthetic training data used for training the character detection system. The original stele images are currently being investigated by the [VIETNAMICA](https://vietnamica.hypotheses.org) research project and need to be requested via this project.

Please contact the authors if you have any questions.
